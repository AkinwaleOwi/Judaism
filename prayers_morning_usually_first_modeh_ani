Here is Modeh Ani, the short prayer traditionally said immediately upon waking in the morning before Shacharit:

Hebrew

מוֹדֶה אֲנִי לְפָנֶיךָ
מֶלֶךְ חַי וְקַיָּם
שֶׁהֶחֱזַרְתָּ בִּי נִשְׁמָתִי בְּחֶמְלָה
רַבָּה אֱמוּנָתֶךָ

(Women traditionally say “מוֹדָה אֲנִי” instead of “מוֹדֶה אֲנִי.”)

English Translation

I give thanks before You,
living and eternal King,
for You have returned my soul within me with compassion;
abundant is Your faithfulness.
=========================================================
Here’s a simple line-by-line explanation of Modeh Ani:

מוֹדֶה / מוֹדָה אֲנִי לְפָנֶיךָ

“I thank You before You”

The prayer begins immediately with gratitude. Before asking for anything, we acknowledge thanks.
“Before You” suggests a personal, direct relationship — as if standing in God’s presence upon waking.

מֶלֶךְ חַי וְקַיָּם

“Living and eternal King”

God is described as:

Living — actively present, not distant.

Eternal — beyond time, unchanging.

This emphasizes stability: even after sleep (a small taste of vulnerability), God remains constant.

שֶׁהֶחֱזַרְתָּ בִּי נִשְׁמָתִי

“For You have returned my soul within me”

Jewish tradition views sleep as a partial withdrawal of the soul.
Waking up is seen as a gift — the soul is “returned,” giving us another day of life and purpose.

בְּחֶמְלָה

“With compassion”

Life is not owed — it is granted lovingly.
This word highlights divine mercy and kindness.

רַבָּה אֱמוּנָתֶךָ

“Great is Your faithfulness”

Interestingly, this doesn’t speak about our faith in God — but God’s faith in us.
By returning our soul, God shows trust that we can fulfill our purpose today.

Overall Meaning

Modeh Ani sets the tone for the entire day:

Start with gratitude.

Recognize life as a gift.

Remember that you are trusted with a new opportunity.

It’s short, but spiritually very deep.
