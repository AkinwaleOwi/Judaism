The third blessing of the Amidah is called Kedushat Hashem (“Holiness of the Name”). In the weekday Amidah, it focuses on sanctifying God’s name.

Here is the standard English translation (weekday version):

You are holy, and Your Name is holy, and holy ones praise You every day, Selah.
Blessed are You, Lord, the holy God.

On Shabbat and festivals, the third blessing includes an expanded Kedushah (responsive sanctification), with verses such as:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole world is filled with His glory.”
(from Book of Isaiah 6:3)

If you’d like, I can also provide the full Kedushah text used in communal prayer.
