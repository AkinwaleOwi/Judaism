===================================
The second blessing of the Amidah is called Gevurot (“Powers” or “Might”). It praises God’s power, especially His power to give life and resurrect the dead.

Here is the traditional English translation (Ashkenazic version):
=============================================================================

You are mighty forever, O Lord; You revive the dead; You are powerful to save.
You sustain the living with kindness, revive the dead with great mercy, support the fallen, heal the sick, free the captive, and keep faith with those who sleep in the dust.
Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds? Who can be compared to You, O King, who brings death and restores life, and causes salvation to sprout?
And You are faithful to revive the dead.
Blessed are You, Lord, who revives the dead.

Seasonal Addition
During the rainy season (from Shemini Atzeret to Passover), the line:

“He causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall.”

is inserted after “You are powerful to save.”
This blessing emphasizes God’s power over life, death, healing, and redemption.

==========================================================
==============================
“keep faith with those who sleep in the dust”

refers to God’s faithfulness to the dead — meaning, He does not abandon them and will ultimately fulfill His promise to resurrect them.
