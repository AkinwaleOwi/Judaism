While the Torah does not explicitly list modern "inventors" in the technological sense, it features several foundational figures who developed, built, or designed crucial items that changed human history. 

Key figures mentioned in the Torah include:

Noah: Built the Ark, the first massive, watertight vessel designed to preserve life, which is seen as a foundational development in shipbuilding and preservation [Genesis 6-9].

Bezalel: Considered the first Jewish artist and inventor of sacred tools, he was directly appointed by God and filled with wisdom to design the Tabernacle (Mishkan), the Ark of the Covenant, and its intricate vessels [Exodus 31].

Tubal-cain: Recognized as the first forger of bronze and iron tools, representing the dawn of metallurgy and tool-making in human history [Genesis 4:22].

Jabal: Described as the father of those who dwell in tents and own livestock, introducing advancements in pastoral living and portable, nomadic shelter [Genesis 4:20].

Jubal: Credited as the ancestor of all who play the harp and pipe, effectively inventing organized musical instruments and performance [Genesis 4:21]. 

These figures are depicted as pioneers of essential human technologies—maritime, art/design, metallurgy, agriculture, and music—within the foundational biblical narrative.
