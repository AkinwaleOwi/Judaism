Here is the English translation of Ashrei (Psalm 145), commonly recited during Mincha:

Ashrei

Happy are those who dwell in Your house; may they continually praise You.
Happy is the people for whom this is so; happy is the people whose God is the Lord.

A psalm of David.

I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and I will bless Your Name forever and ever.

Every day I will bless You,
and I will praise Your Name forever and ever.

Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised;
His greatness is beyond all understanding.

Generation to generation will praise Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.

They will speak of the splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and I will meditate on Your wondrous deeds.

They will tell of the power of Your awesome acts,
and I will recount Your greatness.

They will eagerly utter the memory of Your abundant goodness
and sing joyfully of Your righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindness.

The Lord is good to all,
and His mercy is upon all His works.

All Your works shall praise You, O Lord,
and Your faithful ones shall bless You.

They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom
and talk of Your power,

to make known to humanity His mighty acts
and the glorious splendor of His kingdom.

Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
and Your dominion endures throughout all generations.

The Lord supports all who fall
and raises up all who are bowed down.

The eyes of all look to You with hope,
and You give them their food in its proper time.

You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

The Lord is righteous in all His ways
and kind in all His deeds.

The Lord is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.

He fulfills the desire of those who fear Him;
He hears their cry and saves them.

The Lord guards all who love Him,
but all the wicked He will destroy.

My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord,
and all flesh shall bless His holy Name forever and ever.
