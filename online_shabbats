📌 Notes & Tips for Joining


Most services are free and open to the public via Zoom, YouTube, Facebook, or embedded livestream players. 


Some communities provide interactive elements (chat, Zoom participation) while others are offered as a watch-only livestream. 


Times are typically Friday evenings (Kabbalat Shabbat) and Saturday mornings — check each congregation’s calendar for exact times.


If you want more specific options (e.g., Orthodox, Reform, egalitarian, family-focused, or in Hebrew/English), let me know and I can tailor the list!
