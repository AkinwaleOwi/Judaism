The Amidah is the core silent prayer of every Jewish service. During Shacharit on weekdays, it contains 19 blessings divided into three sections.

=====================================================
Here is the first blessing of the Amidah (called Avot, “Patriarchs”) in standard English translation:

First Blessing – Avot

Blessed are You, Lord our God and God of our fathers,
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob,
the great, mighty, and awesome God,
God Most High,
who bestows loving, kindness and creates all,
who remembers the kindness of the fathers
and brings a redeemer to their children’s children
for His Name’s sake, in love.

King, Helper, Savior, and Shield.
Blessed are You, Lord, Shield of Abraham.
