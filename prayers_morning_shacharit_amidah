The Amidah (Standing Prayer)

The Amidah is the core silent prayer of every Jewish service. During Shacharit on weekdays, it contains 19 blessings divided into three sections:

1️⃣ Praise (First 3 Blessings)

Praises God as the God of the Patriarchs

Acknowledges God’s power

Sanctifies God’s Name

2️⃣ Requests (Middle Blessings – Weekdays)

These include prayers for:

Wisdom

Repentance

Forgiveness

Redemption

Healing

Prosperity

Justice

Gathering of exiles

Restoration of Jerusalem

Peace

3️⃣ Thanksgiving (Final 3 Blessings)

Gratitude for daily miracles

Temple service (historically)

A prayer for peace

On Shabbat and holidays, the Amidah is shortened to 7 blessings, focusing on the holiness of the day rather than personal requests.

It is recited silently while standing and facing Jerusalem, followed by a repetition by the prayer leader in a minyan.
