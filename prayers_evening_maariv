~~~~~~~~~~~~First Paragraph (Deuteronomy 6:4–9)~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.

Blessed is the Name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.

You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.
And these words that I command you today shall be upon your heart.
You shall teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk along the way, when you lie down and when you rise up.
You shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
You shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates.

~~~~~~~~~~~~Second Paragraph (Deuteronomy 11:13–21)~~~~~~~~~~~~

And it shall be, if you diligently obey My commandments that I command you today, to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,
then I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early rain and the late rain, and you will gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil.
I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied.
Beware lest your heart be misled and you turn astray and serve other gods and bow down to them.
Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produce, and you will quickly perish from the good land that the Lord gives you.
You shall therefore place these words of Mine upon your heart and upon your soul; bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the way, when you lie down and when you rise up.
Write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates,
so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied upon the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~Third Paragraph (Numbers 15:37–41)~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to place a thread of blue on the fringe of each corner.
It shall be to you as a fringe, and you shall look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord and perform them, and you shall not stray after your heart and after your eyes, after which you go astray.
So that you may remember and perform all My commandments and be holy to your God.
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the Lord your God.
